How to create your own shape ?

2. Your file must be composed in the following way : 
  - on the first line, the size and color of the piece in this format: width height color_code\n (the number of
	the color corresponds to the ncurses capacity’s color numbers)
  - on the h following lines (where h is the height of the tetrimino), the piece’s shape composed with asterisks (*)
	and spaces (" ").
